 This electronic book is a survey of basic concepts in the
    mathematical study of programs and programming languages.  Topics
    include advanced use of the Coq proof assistant, operational
    semantics, Hoare logic, and static type systems.  The exposition
    is intended for a broad range of readers, from advanced
    undergraduates to PhD students and researchers.  No specific
    background in logic or programming languages is assumed, though a
    degree of mathematical maturity will be helpful.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    As with all of the books in the <i>Software Foundations</i> series,
    this one is one hundred percent formalized and machine-checked:
    the entire text is literally a script for Coq.  It is intended to
    be read alongside (or inside) an interactive session with Coq.
    All the details in the text are fully formalized in Coq, and most
    of the exercises are designed to be worked using Coq.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The files are organized into a sequence of core chapters, covering
    about one half semester's worth of material and organized into a
    coherent linear narrative, plus a number of "offshoot" chapters
    covering additional topics.  All the core chapters are suitable
    for both upper-level undergraduate and graduate students.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The book builds on the material from <i>Logical Foundations</i>
    (<i>Software Foundations</i>, volume 1).  It can be used together with
    that book for a one-semester course on the theory of programming
    languages.  Or, for classes where students who are already
    familiar with some or all of the material in <i>Logical
    Foundations</i>, there is plenty of additional material to fill most
    of a semester from this book alone.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 The book develops two main conceptual threads:

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    (1) formal techniques for <i>reasoning about the properties of
        specific programs</i> (e.g., the fact that a sorting function or
        a compiler obeys some formal specification); and

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    (2) the use of <i>type systems</i> for establishing well-behavedness
        guarantees for <i>all</i> programs in a given programming
        language (e.g., the fact that well-typed Java programs cannot
        be subverted at runtime).

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Each of these is easily rich enough to fill a whole course in its
    own right, and tackling both together naturally means that much
    will be left unsaid.  Nevertheless, we hope readers will find that
    these themes illuminate and amplify each other and that bringing
    them together creates a good foundation for digging into any of
    them more deeply.  Some suggestions for further reading can be
    found in the <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">Postscript</span></span> chapter.  Bibliographic information
    for all cited works can be found in the file <span class="inlinecode"><span class="id" title="var">Bib</span></span>.

<a id="lab415"></a><h2 class="section">Program Verification</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 In the first part of the book, we introduce two broad topics of
    critical importance in building reliable software (and hardware):
    techniques for proving specific properties of particular
    <i>programs</i> and for proving general properties of whole programming
    <i>languages</i>.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    For both of these, the first thing we need is a way of
    representing programs as mathematical objects, so we can talk
    about them precisely, plus ways of describing their behavior in
    terms of mathematical functions or relations.  Our main tools for
    these tasks are <i>abstract syntax</i> and <i>operational semantics</i>, a
    method of specifying programming languages by writing abstract
    interpreters.  At the beginning, we work with operational
    semantics in the so-called "big-step" style, which leads to simple
    and readable definitions when it is applicable.  Later on, we
    switch to a lower-level "small-step" style, which helps make some
    useful distinctions (e.g., between different sorts of
    nonterminating program behaviors) and which is applicable to a
    broader range of language features, including concurrency.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    The first programming language we consider in detail is <i>Imp</i>, a
    tiny toy language capturing the core features of conventional
    imperative programming: variables, assignment, conditionals, and
    loops.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    We study two different ways of reasoning about the properties of
    Imp programs.  First, we consider what it means to say that two
    Imp programs are <i>equivalent</i> in the intuitive sense that they
    exhibit the same behavior when started in any initial memory
    state.  This notion of equivalence then becomes a criterion for
    judging the correctness of <i>metaprograms</i> -- programs that
    manipulate other programs, such as compilers and optimizers.  We
    build a simple optimizer for Imp and prove that it is correct.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Second, we develop a methodology for proving that a given Imp
    program satisfies some formal specifications of its behavior.  We
    introduce the notion of <i>Hoare triples</i> -- Imp programs annotated
    with pre- and post-conditions describing what they expect to be
    true about the memory in which they are started and what they
    promise to make true about the memory in which they terminate --
    and the reasoning principles of <i>Hoare Logic</i>, a domain-specific
    logic specialized for convenient compositional reasoning about
    imperative programs, with concepts like "loop invariant" built in.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This part of the course is intended to give readers a taste of the
    key ideas and mathematical tools used in a wide variety of
    real-world software and hardware verification tasks.

<a id="lab416"></a><h2 class="section">Type Systems</h2>

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

 Our other major topic, covering approximately the second half of
    the book, is <i>type systems</i> -- powerful tools for establishing
    properties of <i>all</i> programs in a given language.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    Type systems are the best established and most popular example of
    a highly successful class of formal verification techniques known
    as <i>lightweight formal methods</i>.  These are reasoning techniques
    of modest power -- modest enough that automatic checkers can be
    built into compilers, linkers, or program analyzers and thus be
    applied even by programmers unfamiliar with the underlying
    theories.  Other examples of lightweight formal methods include
    hardware and software model checkers, contract checkers, and
    run-time monitoring techniques.

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

    This also completes a full circle with the beginning of the book:
    the language whose properties we study in this part, the <i>simply
    typed lambda-calculus</i>, is essentially a simplified model of the
    core of Coq itself!
